        "description": "The game involves rolling 2 dice; if the user rolls a 7, they win; otherwise, they lose. To play, you must register beforehand either as an anonymous user or using a username and email, with the advantage of being able to check your results (previous rolls and average). There is a ranking for the best player, the worst player and the overall ranking, which is restricted by the administrator user. All of this follows the MVC design pattern.",
